This project deals with two of the most important problems in data science. Cost sensitive learning and Class Imbalance


In the first part we use the Statlog (heart) dataset from the UCI repository and the accompanying cost matrix. 
Then we use Random Forest, Linear SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms to extract results

In the second part, we work on the problem of Class Imbalance. We use the CreditCardFraud dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) 
using Random Forest, Linear SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms to derive results
